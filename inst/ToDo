# ToDo: #

* âˆš Make CV.SuperLearner parallel. Allow user to only make outer loop parallel, only inner loop parallel, or both. Should run a few tests to see how the options compare.
* improve summary.CV.SuperLearner and summary.SuperLearner
* Figure out a way to get verbose output when using mcSuperLearner and snowSuperLearner, maybe something like a progress bar.
